`ocean-lib` is a Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, 
and consume data. With it, you can:
* **Publish** data services: downloadable files, streaming data, or compute-to-data. 
Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) 
data token for each data service or set of services.
* **Mint** data tokens for the service
* **Consume** data tokens, to access the service
* **Transfer** data tokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions** 
using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) etc.

`ocean-lib` is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.
