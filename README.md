With ocean.py, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data.
  Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md)
  datatoken for each dataset / data service.
- **Mint** datatokens for the service
- **Sell** datatokens via an OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto price discovery), or for a fixed price
- **Stake** OCEAN on datatoken pools
- **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
- **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions**
  using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) etc.

ocean.py is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in beta state and you can expect running into problems. If you run into them, please open up a [new issue](/issues).

- [üèó Installation](#-installation)
- [üèÑ Quickstart](#-quickstart): simple flow, marketplace, compute-to-data, more
- [ü¶ë Development](#-development)
- [üèõ License](#-license)

## üèó Installation

```console
#Install the ocean.py library. Install wheel first to avoid errors.
pip install wheel
pip install ocean-lib
```
‚ö†Ô∏è For Mac users, if you encounter an issue with "Unsupported Architecture", see [this issue](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/issues/486) for an explanation and run the installation command with ARCHFLAGS set, like so:

`ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip install ocean-lib`

## üèÑ Quickstart

Here are flows to try out, from simple to specific detailed variants.

- **[Simple flow](READMEs/datatokens-flow.md)** - the essence of Ocean - creating a data NFT & datatoken.
- **[Marketplace flow](READMEs/marketplace-flow.md)** - a data asset is posted for sale in a datatoken pool, then purchased. Includes metadata.
- **[Fixed rate exchange flow](READMEs/fixed-rate-exchange-flow.md)** - a data asset is posted for sale at fixed rate, then purchased. 
- **[Compute-to-data flow](READMEs/c2d-flow.md)** - uses C2D to build an AI model a dataset that never leaves the premises.
