With ocean.py, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 **data NFT** for each service, and ERC20 **datatoken** for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
- **Sell** datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
- **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions** using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io), [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.

ocean.py is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in beta state. If you run into problems, please open up a [new issue](/issues).

## üèÑ Quickstart

Here are flows to try out, from simple to specific detailed variants.

- **[Installation](READMEs/install.md)** - need for each flow below
- **[Simple flow](READMEs/data-nfts-and-datatokens-flow.md)** - publish a dataset's data NFT and datatoken
- **[Publish flow](READMEs/publish-flow.md)** - publish a dataset's data NFT, datatoken _and_ metadata (DDO)
- **[Consume flow](READMEs/consume-flow.md)** - download a dataset
- **[Post priced data](READMEs/marketplace-flow.md)** - post a dataset for sale, having a fixed price
- **[Post free data](READMEs/dispenser-flow.md)** - post a dataset for free, via a faucet
- **[Search & filter data](READMEs/search-and-filter-assets.md)** - find assets by tag

### Remote flows

- **[Get test MATIC](READMEs/get-test-MATIC.md)** - from Mumbai network
- **[Simple remote flow](READMEs/simple-remote.md)** - like the simple flow, but using _remote_ services
- **[C2D flow](READMEs/c2d-flow.md)** - uses Compute-to-Data to build an AI model

### More types of data assets

- **[REST API flow](READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md)** - publish & consume REST API data, showing Binance ETH price feed
- **[GraphQL flow](READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md)** - publish & consume GraphQL data
- **[On-chain data flow](READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)** - publish & consume on-chain data

### Key-value flows

- [Key-value database](READMEs/key-value-flow.md) - use data NFTs to store arbitrary key-value pairs on-chain, following ERC725
- [Profile NFTs](READMEs/profile-nfts-flow.md) - enable "login with Web3" where Dapp can access private user profile data

### Use-case flows

- [Predict-eth](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth) - data challenges with $ to predict future ETH price
- [Data Farming](READMEs/df.md) - curate data assets, earn rewards

### Learn more

- [Get test OCEAN](READMEs/get-test-OCEAN.md) - from Goerli
- [Understand config parameters](READMEs/parameters.md) - envvars vs files
- [Learn about off-chain services](READMEs/services.md) - Ocean Provider for data services, Aquarius metadata store

## ü¶ë Development

- **[Developers flow](READMEs/developers.md)** - to further develop ocean.py
- [Release process](READMEs/release-process.md) - to do a new release of ocean.py
