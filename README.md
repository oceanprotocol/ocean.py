# ocean-lib

`ocean-lib` is a Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, 
and consume data. With it, you can:
* **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. 
Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) 
datatoken for each data set.
* **Mint** datatokens to allow buying/consuming the data service
* **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
* **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions** 
using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) etc.
* **Price** datatokens in terms of OCEAN tokens by creating a Balancer pool of `datatoken <> OCEAN`
* **Stake** OCEAN tokens on specific datatokens (by adding OCEAN liquidity into a datatoken Balancer pool)
* Buy datatokens from available Balancer pools or from fixed price exchange if available
* And much more ...


`ocean-lib` is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

[Here's](READMEs/overview.md) a short description of key ocean-lib modules and functions.

### 3. Quickstart marketplace flow

[This quickstart](READMEs/marketplace_flow.md) describes how to publish data assets as datatokens (including metadata), post the datatokens to a marketplace, buy datatokens, and consume datatokens (including download).
