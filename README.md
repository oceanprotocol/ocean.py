With ocean.py, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 **data NFT** for each service, and ERC20 **datatoken** for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
- **Sell** datatokens via an OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto price discovery), or for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
- **Stake OCEAN** on datatoken pools
- **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions** using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io), [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.

ocean.py is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in beta state. If you run into problems, please open up a [new issue](/issues).

- [üèó Installation](#-installation)
- [üèÑ Quickstart](#-quickstart): simple flow, marketplace, compute-to-data, more
- [ü¶ë Development](#-development)
- [üèõ License](#-license)

## üèó Installation

```console
#Install the ocean.py library. Install wheel first to avoid errors.
pip install wheel
pip install ocean-lib
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Mac users: if you encounter an "Unsupported Architecture" issue, then install including ARCHFLAGS: `ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip install ocean-lib`. [[Details](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/issues/486).]

## üèÑ Quickstart

Here are flows to try out, from simple to specific detailed variants.

- **[Simple flow](READMEs/datatokens-flow.md)** - the essence of Ocean - creating a data NFT & datatoken.
- **[Marketplace flow](READMEs/marketplace-flow.md)** - a data asset is posted for sale in a datatoken pool, then purchased. Includes metadata.
- **[Fixed rate exchange flow](READMEs/fixed-rate-exchange-flow.md)** - a data asset is posted for sale at fixed rate, then purchased. 
- **[Dispenser flow](READMEs/dispenser-flow.md)** - here, a datatoken dispenser is created and datatokens are dispensed for free.
- **[Compute-to-data flow](READMEs/c2d-flow.md)** - uses C2D to build an AI model a dataset that never leaves the premises.
