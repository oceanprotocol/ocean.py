> Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, and consume data.

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a0be65f412a35440c63e/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/maintainability) 
[![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a0be65f412a35440c63e/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/test_coverage)

With ocean.py, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 **data NFT** for each service, and ERC20 **datatoken** for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
- **Sell** datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
- **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions** using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io), [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), etc.

ocean.py is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in beta state. If you run into problems, please open up a [new issue](/issues).

- [üèó Installation](#-installation)
- [üèÑ Quickstart](#-quickstart): simple flow, marketplace, compute-to-data, more
- [ü¶ë Development](#-development)
- [üèõ License](#-license)

## üèó Installation

```console
#Install the ocean.py library. Allow pre-releases for the latest v4 version. Install wheel first to avoid errors.
pip install wheel
pip install --pre ocean-lib
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Mac users: if you encounter an "Unsupported Architecture" issue, then install including ARCHFLAGS: `ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip install ocean-lib`. [[Details](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/issues/486).]

## üèÑ Quickstart

Here are flows to try out, from simple to specific detailed variants.

- **[Simple flow](READMEs/data-nfts-and-datatokens-flow.md)** - the essence of Ocean - creating a data NFT & datatoken.
- **[Publish flow](READMEs/publish-flow.md)** - a dataset is published.
- **[Consume flow](READMEs/consume-flow.md)** - a published dataset is consumed (downloaded).
- **[Marketplace flow](READMEs/marketplace-flow.md)** - a data asset is posted for sale at fixed rate, then purchased.
- **[Dispenser flow](READMEs/dispenser-flow.md)** - here, a datatoken dispenser is created and datatokens are dispensed for free.

### Remote flows

- **[Get test MATIC](READMEs/get-test-MATIC.md)** - from Mumbai network
- **[Simple remote flow](READMEs/simple-remote.md)** - like the simple flow, but using _remote_ services.
- **[Compute-to-data flow](READMEs/c2d-flow.md)** - uses C2D to build an AI model.

### More types of data assets

- **[REST API flow](READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md)** - publish & consume REST API-style URIs, showing Binance ETH price feed
- **[GraphQL flow](READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md)** - publish & consume GraphQL-style URIs
- **[On-chain data flow](READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)** - publish & consume on-chain data

### Data Bounties flows

- [Predict future ETH price](READMEs/predict-eth.md) - predict future ETH price via a local AI model

### Key-value flows

- [Key-value database](READMEs/key-value-flow.md) - use data NFTs to store arbitrary key-value pairs on-chain.
- [Profile NFTs](READMEs/profile-nfts-flow.md) - enable "login with Web3" where Dapp can access private user profile data.

### Learn more

- [Get test OCEAN](READMEs/get-test-OCEAN.md) - from Goerli
- [Understand config parameters](READMEs/parameters.md) - envvars vs files
- [Learn about off-chain services](READMEs/services.md) - Ocean Provider for data services, Aquarius metadata store
- [Learn about wallets](READMEs/wallets.md) - on generating, storing, and accessing private keys

## ü¶ë Development

- **[Developers flow](READMEs/developers.md)** - to further develop ocean.py
- [Release process](READMEs/release-process.md) - to do a new release of ocean.py
