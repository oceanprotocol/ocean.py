# ocean-lib

`ocean-lib` is a Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, and consume data. With it, you can:
* **Publish** data services: static data, streaming data, or compute-to-data. Every data service gets its own [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) token.
* **Mint** data tokens for a given data service
* **Transfer** data tokens to another owner
* **Consume** data tokens, to access the service

`ocean-lib` is part of the [Ocean Protocol](www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.
