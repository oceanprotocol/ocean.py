With ocean.py, you can:

-   **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data.
    Ocean creates a new [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md)
    datatoken for each dataset / data service.
-   **Mint** datatokens for the service
-   **Sell** datatokens via an OCEAN-datatoken Balancer pool (for auto price discovery), or for a fixed price
-   **Stake** OCEAN on datatoken pools
-   **Consume** datatokens, to access the service
-   **Transfer** datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC20 actions**
    using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) etc.

ocean.py is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in beta state and you can expect running into problems. If you run into them, please open up a [new issue](/issues).
