> Python library to privately & securely publish, exchange, and consume data.

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a0be65f412a35440c63e/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/maintainability)
[![Test Coverage](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a0be65f412a35440c63e/test_coverage)](https://codeclimate.com/github/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/test_coverage)

With ocean.py, you can:

- **Publish** data services: downloadable files or compute-to-data. Create an ERC721 **data NFT** for each service, and ERC20 **datatoken** for access (1.0 datatokens to access).
- **Sell** datatokens via for a fixed price. Sell data NFTs.
- **Transfer** data NFTs & datatokens to another owner, and **all other ERC721 & ERC20 actions** using [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io) or [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

ocean.py is part of the [Ocean Protocol](https://www.oceanprotocol.com) toolset.

This is in beta state. If you run into problems, please open up a [new issue](/issues).

## üèÑ Quickstart

Follow these steps in sequence to ramp into Ocean.

 1. **[Install Ocean](READMEs/install.md)**
 2. **[Set up locally](READMEs/setup-local.md)** 
 3. **[Walk through main flow (local setup)](READMEs/main-flow.md)**: publish asset, post for free / for sale, dispense it / buy it, and consume it
 
Now let's do remote flows:

 4. **[Set up remotely](READMEs/setup-remote.md)**
 5. **[Walk through main flow (remote setup)](READMEs/main-flow.md)**. Like step 3, but on wholly remote network
 6. **[Walk through C2D flow](READMEs/c2d-flow.md)** - tokenize & monetize AI algorithm via Compute-to-Data

### Use-case flows

- [Predict-eth](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth) - data challenges with prize $$ to predict future ETH price
- [Data Farming](READMEs/df.md) - curate data assets, earn rewards
- [Search & filter data](READMEs/search-and-filter-assets.md) - find assets by tag
- [Key-value database](READMEs/key-value-flow.md) - use data NFTs to store arbitrary key-value pairs on-chain, following ERC725
- [Profile NFTs](READMEs/profile-nfts-flow.md) - enable "login with Web3" where Dapp can access private user profile data


### More types of data assets

Each of the following shows how to publish & consume a particular type of data.
- **[REST API](READMEs/publish-flow-restapi.md)** - Example on Binance ETH price feed
- **[GraphQL](READMEs/publish-flow-graphql.md)** - Example on Ocean Data NFTs
- **[On-chain data](READMEs/publish-flow-onchain.md)** - Example on Ocean swap fees.

### Learn more
- [Understand config parameters](READMEs/parameters.md) - envvars vs files
- [Learn about off-chain services](READMEs/services.md) - Ocean Provider for data services, Aquarius metadata store

## ü¶ë Development

- **[Developers flow](READMEs/developers.md)** - to further develop ocean.py
- [Release process](READMEs/release-process.md) - to do a new release of ocean.py
