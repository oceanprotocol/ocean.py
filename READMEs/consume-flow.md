# Quickstart: Consume Flow

This quickstart describes how data is consumed / downloaded, including metadata.

It focuses on Alice's experience as a publisher, and Bob's experience as a consumer.

Here are the steps:

1.  Setup
2.  Alice publishes dataset
3.  Alice gives Bob access
4.  Bob downloads it

Let's go through each step.

## 1. Setup

From [installation-flow](install.md), do:
- [x] Setup : Prerequisites
- [x] Setup : Download barge and run services
- [x] Setup : Install the library
- [x] Setup : Set envvars

From [data-nfts-and-datatokens-flow](data-nfts-and-datatokens-flow.md), do:
- [x] Setup : Setup in Python

## 2. Alice publishes dataset

Now, you're Alice. From [publish-flow](publish-flow.md), do:
- [x] 2. Publish Dataset

## 3. Alice gives Bob access

Bob wants to consume the dataset that Alice just published. The first step is for Bob to get 1.0 datatokens. Similar to any ERC20 token, options include (a) buy a datatoken in a data market, (b) buying it over-the-counter (OTC), (c) having Alice transfer a datatoken to you (`datatoken.transfer()`), or (d) having Alice mint one into your wallet.

This README uses (d) - minting. Specifically, Alice mints a datatoken into Bob's wallet. In the same Python console:
```python
from web3.main import Web3
datatoken_address = ddo.datatokens[0]["address"]
datatoken = ocean.get_datatoken(datatoken_address)
to_address = bob_wallet.address
amt_tokens = Web3.toWei(10, "ether") #just need 1, send more for spare
datatoken.mint(to_address, amt_tokens, {"from": alice_wallet})
```

## 4. Bob downloads the dataset

In the same Python console:
```python
# Bob sends a datatoken to the service to get access; then downloads
file_name = ocean.assets.download_file(ddo.did, bob_wallet)
```

Bob can verify that the file is downloaded. In a new console:

```console
cd my_project/datafile.did:op:0xAf07...
ls branin.arff
```

Congrats to Bob for buying and consuming a data asset!


## Appendix. Further Flexibility

Step 4's `download_file()` did three things:

- Checked if Bob has access tokens. Bob did, so nothing else needed
- Sent a datatoken to the service to get access
- Downloaded the file

Here are the last two steps, un-bundled.

In the same Python console:
```python
# Bob sends a datatoken to the service, to get access
order_tx_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_access_service(ddo, bob_wallet)
print(f"order_tx_id = '{order_tx_id}'")

# Bob downloads the file
# If the connection breaks, Bob can request again by showing order_tx_id.
file_path = ocean.assets.download_asset(
    asset=ddo,
    consumer_wallet=bob_wallet,
    destination='./',
    order_tx_id=order_tx_id
)
```


## Appendix: Further Flexibility Yet

We can un-bundle even further:
- `pay_for_access_service()` fills in good defaults of using the 0th service (if >1 services available) and zero fees.
- And `download_asset()` fills in a good default for `service` too, as well as for `index` and `userdata` (not shown).

Here's how it looks, fully un-bundled.

In the same python console:
```python
# Bob retrieves the reference to the service object
service = ddo.services[0]

# Bob sends a datatoken to the service, to get access
order_tx_id = ocean.assets.pay_for_access_service(
    ddo,
    bob_wallet,
    service,
    consume_market_order_fee_address=bob_wallet.address,
    consume_market_order_fee_token=datatoken.address,
    consume_market_order_fee_amount=0,
)

# Bob now has access! He downloads the asset.
file_path = ocean.assets.download_asset(
    asset=ddo,
    consumer_wallet=bob_wallet,
    destination='./',
    order_tx_id=order_tx_id,
    service=service
)
```

## Appendix: About ARFF

The file is in ARFF format, used by some AI/ML tools. In our example, it has two input variables (x0, x1) and one output.

```console
% 1. Title: Branin Function
% 3. Number of instances: 225
% 6. Number of attributes: 2

@relation branin

@attribute 'x0' numeric
@attribute 'x1' numeric
@attribute 'y' numeric

@data
-5.0000,0.0000,308.1291
-3.9286,0.0000,206.1783
...
```
