# Publish your first datatoken

## A. Set Ethereum network & node (Rinkeby & Infura)

1. Infura runs hosted Ethereum nodes. Go to https://infura.io and sign up 

2. At Infura site, create a new project

3. Within the project settings page, note your Infura `project id` value. We will use it in the next step.

4. Make the network available as an envvar. In console:
```
export NETWORK_URL=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<your Infura project id>
```

## B. Set Ethereum account and get Rinkeby ETH

1. [Install Metamask to your browser](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/). This will generate an Ethereum account for you. 

2. [Export the private key from Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-Export-an-Account-Private-Key). Write it down.

3. [Get Rinkeby ETH from a faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Have it sent to  the your Metamask's Ethereum account address.

4. Make your private key available as an envvar. In console:
```
export MY_TEST_KEY=<my_private_key>
```

## C. Install ocean-lib

In bash console:
```console
#create a python virtualenv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 

#install!
pip install ocean-lib
```

## D. Publish datatokens

In Python console:
```python
import os
from ocean_lib.ocean.ocean import Ocean
from ocean_lib.web3_internal.wallet import Wallet

private_key = os.getenv('MY_TEST_KEY')
config = {'network': os.getenv('NETWORK_URL')}
ocean = Ocean(config)

print("create wallet: begin")
wallet = Wallet(ocean.web3, private_key=private_key)
print(f"create wallet: done. Its address is {wallet.address}")

print("create datatoken: begin. This will take a few seconds, since it's a transaction on Rinkeby.")
datatoken = ocean.create_data_token("Dataset name", "dtsymbol", from_wallet=wallet) 
print(f"created datatoken: done. Its address is {datatoken.address}")
```

If you made it to the end: congrats, you have created your first Ocean datatoken! üêã

Or, if you got an error like "insufficient funds for gas", it's because your account doesn't have enough ETH to pay for gas. Get more from the faucet linked above.
