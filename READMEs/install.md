## Setup
This quickstart describes the required setup to run `ocean.py` flows.

### 🏗 Installation

#### ⚙️ Prerequisites

-   Linux/MacOS
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), [allowing non-root users](https://www.thegeekdiary.com/run-docker-as-a-non-root-user/)
-   Python 3.8.5 - Python 3.10.4

In a new console:

```console
# Create your working directory
mkdir my_project
cd my_project

# Initialize virtual environment and activate it. Install artifacts.
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

##### Install the library
```console
# Avoid errors for the step that follows
pip3 install wheel

# Install Ocean library. Allow pre-releases to get the latest v4 version.
pip3 install --pre ocean-lib

```

#### ⚠️ Known issues

- for M1 processors, `coincurve` and `cryptography` installation may fail due to missing packages, which come pre-packaged in other operating systems. Make sure you have `autoconf`, `automake` and `libtool` installed, e.g. using Homebrew or MacPorts.

- Mac users: if you encounter an "Unsupported Architecture" issue, then install including ARCHFLAGS: `ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" pip install ocean-lib`. [[Details](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/issues/486).]

### Configure brownie & network

ocean.py uses brownie to connect to deployed smart contracts.
Please check that you have configured RPC URLs, gas prices and other settings to
all networks according to your preferences by editing the `network-config.yaml` in your `~/.brownie` folder
before proceeding.
Your default `network-config.yaml` includes values for most [Ocean-deployed](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/core-concepts/networks) chains.
One exception is Energy Web Chain. To support it, add the following to your `network-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
- name: energyweb
  networks:
  - chainid: 246
    host: https://rpc.energyweb.org
    id: energyweb
    name: energyweb
```
⚠️ Ocean.py follows the exact `id` name for networks name from the default brownie configuration file.
Make sure that your wanted network name matches the corresponding brownie `id`.

Please check that you have configured all networks before proceeding. Here is a more complete sample from brownie itself: https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/v1.6.5/config.html.

### ⬇️Download barge and run services

Ocean `barge` runs ganache (local blockchain), Provider (data service), and Aquarius (metadata cache).

In a new console:

```console
# Grab repo
git clone https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge
cd barge

# Clean up old containers (to be sure)
docker system prune -a --volumes

# Run barge: start Ganache, Provider, Aquarius; deploy contracts; update ~/.ocean
./start_ocean.sh
```


### 🔧 Set envvars

In the same console (or another one with venv activated):
```console
export TEST_PRIVATE_KEY1=0x8467415bb2ba7c91084d932276214b11a3dd9bdb2930fefa194b666dd8020b99
export TEST_PRIVATE_KEY2=0x1d751ded5a32226054cd2e71261039b65afb9ee1c746d055dd699b1150a5befc
```
