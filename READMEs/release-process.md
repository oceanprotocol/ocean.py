# The ocean.py Release Process

-   Create a new local feature branch, e.g. `git checkout -b feature/bumpversion-to-v0.2.5`

-   Use the `bumpversion.sh` script to bump the project version. You can execute the script using {major|minor|patch} as first argument to bump the version accordingly:
    -   To bump the patch version: `./bumpversion.sh patch`
    -   To bump the minor version: `./bumpversion.sh minor`
    -   To bump the major version: `./bumpversion.sh major`

-   Commit the changes to the feature branch.

-   Push the feature branch to GitHub.

-   Make a pull request from the just-pushed branch.

-   Wait for all the tests to pass!

-   Merge the pull request into the `main` branch.

-   To make a GitHub release (which creates a Git tag):
    -   Go to the ocean.py repo's Releases page <https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/releases>
    -   Click "Draft a new release".
    -   For tag version, put something like `v0.2.5`
    -   For release title, put the same value (like `v0.2.5`).
    -   For the target, select the `main` branch, or the just-merged commit.
    -   Describe the main changes. (In the future, these will come from the changelog.)
    -   Click "Publish release".

-   Travis will detect the release (a new tag) and run the deployment section of [.travis.yml](.travis.yml), i.e.

    ```yaml
    deploy:
    provider: pypi
    distributions: sdist bdist_wheel
    user: ${PYPI_USER}
    password: ${PYPI_PASSWORD}
    on:
      tags: true
      repo: oceanprotocol/ocean.py
      python: 3.8
    ```

-   Go to [ocean.py Travis page](https://travis-ci.com/github/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) and check the Travis job. It should deploy a new release to PyPI.

-   Check PyPI for the new release at <https://pypi.org/project/ocean-lib/>
