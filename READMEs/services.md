# About Ocean off-chain services

## Introduction

Ocean uses these off-chain services:

-   [Ocean Provider](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider) is for data services. Specifically, it's a REST API serving requests for two types of data services: static urls (for downloading data) and compute services. It's run by the marketplace or the data publisher.
-   [Ocean Aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius) is metadata cache REST API. This helps to aid search in marketplaces.

We now describe how to use these.

## 1. Set config values for services

Here we use a file to set config values.

In your working directory, create a file `config.ini` and fill it with the following. It will use pre-existing services running for rinkeby testnet.

    [eth-network]
    network = https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/<your Infura project id>

    [resources]
    aquarius.url = AQUARIUS_URL=https://aquarius.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com
    provider.url = PROVIDER_URL=https://provider.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com

Ensure that envvars don't override the config file values:

```console
unset NETWORK_URL AQUARIUS_URL PROVIDER_URL
```

Create an envvar to point to the new config file. In the console:

```console
export CONFIG_FILE=config.ini
```

## 2. Use the services within Python

In Python, import and configure the components / services:

```python
import os
from ocean_lib.config import Config
from ocean_lib.config_provider import ConfigProvider
from ocean_lib.ocean.util import get_web3_connection_provider
from ocean_lib.web3_internal.web3_provider import Web3Provider
from ocean_lib.web3_internal.contract_handler import ContractHandler

#configure the components
config = Config(os.getenv('CONFIG_FILE'))
ConfigProvider.set_config(config)
Web3Provider.init_web3(provider=get_web3_connection_provider(config.network_url))
ContractHandler.set_artifacts_path(config.artifacts_path)
```

Now you're ready to use the services! üê≥ The marketplace tutorial will use them in more detail.

## Alternatives on Services

Above, we described a specific flow to go through configuring services. Here are some variants of that flow.

### Point to services in other networks

The service urls above are for rinkeby. [Ocean's docs have urls](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks) for Ethereum mainnet and other supported networks.

### Run your own services, separately

Above, we pointed to existing services. Alternatively, you can run your own. Here's how.

Open a new console, and get provider running:

```console
docker run oceanprotocol/provider:latest
```

Open another new console, and get aquarius running:

```console
docker run oceanprotocol/aquarius:latest
```

Here are the urls for the local services, for use in `config.ini` etc.

-   Provider url: `http://127.0.0.1:8030`
-   Aquarius url: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

### Run your own services, all at once

Above, we ran all services separately. You can also run [Ocean Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge) to conveniently run them all at once.
